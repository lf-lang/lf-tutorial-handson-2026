# Step 2: When Operations Are Non-Commutative: The Consistency Problem

## Adding Real Business Logic

The simple summation from Step 1 is a [Conflict-Free Replicated Datatype (CRDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type), which is mathematically elegant. But it lets operators destroy the grid: curtailment commands are always honored, even if the balance is already dangerously low.

Real grid operators enforce **safety constraints**. A typical rule:

> **Do not curtail generation if the current balance is already at or below the minimum safe threshold.**
>
> If a curtailment would push the balance below the threshold, reject it and log an **imbalance event** (which triggers automated protective relays in a real system).

Let's say our minimum safe threshold is **−200 MW**. Here is the updated reactor (See [`src/Step2_Inconsistency.lf`](src/Step2_Inconsistency.lf)).

> **Note:** `MIN_SAFE_BALANCE` below is defined in a file-level [`preamble`](https://www.lf-lang.org/docs/writing-reactors/preambles/#preamble). LF preambles are used for target-language declarations such as includes, constants, or shared procedure declarations used by reaction code.


```lf
reactor InconsistentGridManager {
    input in1: int
    input in2: int
    output out: int

    state balance: int = 0

    reaction(in1, in2) -> out {=
        if (in1->is_present) {
            if (self->balance + in1->value >= MIN_SAFE_BALANCE) {
                self->balance += in1->value;
            } else {
                lf_print("WARNING: Imbalance event! Curtailment rejected.");
                // In a real system: trip protective relays, alert operators
            }
        }
        if (in2->is_present) {
            if (self->balance + in2->value >= MIN_SAFE_BALANCE) {
                self->balance += in2->value;
            } else {
                lf_print("WARNING: Imbalance event! Curtailment rejected.");
            }
        }
        lf_set(out, self->balance);
    =}
}
```

Here is what our system looks like:

## Why This Breaks Consistency

This new operation is **not commutative**. The result of applying two commands depends on the order in which they are applied. Consider this scenario:

**Initial state:** both managers have `balance = −150 MW`.

**Two simultaneous commands:**
- California: curtail −80 MW (would bring balance to −230 MW, below threshold)
- New York: dispatch +100 MW (would bring balance to −50 MW)

**Scenario A: California manager sees curtail first:**
1. California curtail (−80): `−150 + (−80) = −230`. Below threshold → **rejected**.
2. New York dispatch (+100): `−150 + 100 = −50`. Applied.
3. Final balance at `gm1`: **−50 MW**. No imbalance event.

**Scenario B: California manager sees dispatch first:**
1. New York dispatch (+100): `−150 + 100 = −50`. Applied.
2. California curtail (−80): `−50 + (−80) = −130`. Above threshold → **applied**.
3. Final balance at `gm1`: **−130 MW**. No imbalance event.

Since `gm1` and `gm2` receive these messages over physical (unordered) connections, they may each experience a different scenario. **They permanently disagree on the balance**, and worse, they may disagree on whether an imbalance event occurred.

This is the fundamental consistency problem in distributed systems.

## Visualizing the Inconsistency

```
Time →
                    T=0ms               T=10ms (approx)
California node:    curtail -80 ──────────────────────────► gm1 sees it first
New York node:                   dispatch +100 ────────────► gm1 sees it second
                                                                   ↓
                                                          gm1 final: -50 MW ✓ no event

California node:    curtail -80 ────────────────────────────────────────────────► gm2 sees it second  
New York node:                   dispatch +100 ──────────────────────────────► gm2 sees it first
                                                                                     ↓
                                                                           gm2 final: -130 MW ✓ no event

But gm1 (-50) ≠ gm2 (-130): INCONSISTENT STATE!
```

In a real grid, this inconsistency means the two control centers have **contradictory views of grid health**. Automated systems making decisions based on these views could take opposing corrective actions, worsening the situation.

## Fixing It: The Options

We'll explore three approaches to fix the inconsistency issue:

| Approach | How | Cost |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Single node** | Keep balance at one node only | Single point of failure; unavailability on network loss |
| **Timestamps** | Tag commands with logical time; enforce ordered processing | Wait time proportional to network latency (CAL theorem) |
| **Chandy-Misra** | Conservative coordination with null messages | Same wait time; tight coupling; blocks on node failure |

The single-node approach defeats the purpose of having two control centers. So we turn to timestamps.

## Exercises

1. In `Step2_Inconsistency.lf`, replace every `~>` with `->` and add `@maxwait(100 ms)` to both `gm1` and `gm2`. Re-run the inconsistency scenario (`balance = −150 MW`, simultaneous curtail −80 MW and dispatch +100 MW). Do the managers now agree?
